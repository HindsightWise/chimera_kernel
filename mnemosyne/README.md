# Mnemosyne v0.4

> Autonomous Zero-Copy Crypto-Vault for Enterprise AI Agents

Mnemosyne is a hybrid Rust/Python cognitive architecture designed explicitly for autonomous reasoning agents (like Hermes, Claude Desktop, and Letta). It bypasses the massive overhead of traditional Python-based memory systems, allowing heavy memory persistence natively on Apple Silicon without triggering memory saturation or kernel panics.

## 🚀 Core Architecture

The architecture utilizes a "Sandwich" model: all heavy numerical computation and constraint checks execute asynchronously in sub-millisecond Rust `cdylib` extensions, while Python acts purely as the routing harness (via `FastMCP`).

1. **Semantic Legislator (`Rhai`)**: Every memory attempt is logically audited by an embedded Rust scripting engine (`rhai`) before being considered.
2. **Direct Numeric Control (DNC)**: A mathematical logic gate that manages Epistemic Uncertainty and Structural Entropy to determine if a memory is a hallucination or an actual fact.
3. **Cryptographic Vault Proxy (`glossopetrae`)**: Once a memory passes physics evaluation, the Rust C-extension mathematically encrypts the memory into pure Occult Runes via military-grade AES. The databases store strictly unreadable ciphers, and only decrypt the text to naked English when queried by the authorized Agent MCP.
4. **LanceDB Vectors**: Passes 384-dimensional `f32` sentence embeddings straight into native Arrow `RecordBatches` flushed to `.lance` datasets for hyper-fast semantic search.
5. **KùzuDB Property Graphs**: Creates zero-copy logical relationships (Nodes & Edges) inside a localized graph database representing the agent's current state.

## 🛠️ Installation & Compilation

Since the core relies on extreme memory limits, everything must be compiled to your native architecture via `maturin`.

### Prerequisites

- Rust & Cargo (`rustup default stable`)
- Python 3.10+
- CMake (minimum 3.5 required for C++ graph driver compilation)

### Building the Core

```bash
# 1. Activate your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install the local embedding generator 
pip install sentence-transformers

# 3. Compile the Rust Extension in Release Mode
PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1 maturin develop --release
```

## 🧠 Connecting Your Agent

Mnemosyne exposes itself as a standard **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server over `stdio`.

Append the following command to your agent framework (example using Hermes CLI):

```bash
hermes mcp add mnemosyne --command /path/to/venv/bin/python --args /Users/zerbytheboss/Monad/mnemosyne/mnemosyne_server.py
```

### Available Tools

- `commit_memory`: The agent uses this tool to store semantic strings and embeddings.

## 📂 Data Storage

All databases automatically construct themselves independently of your agent's main branch inside your system user's root folder:

- **Graph:** `~/.hermes/mnemosyne_data/kuzu_graph/`
- **Vectors:** `~/.hermes/mnemosyne_data/lancedb/`
